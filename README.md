# CardsAgainstData
Cards Against Data Game - Cards Against Humanity for Data Repositories

**We're starting the conversation about this with the DataONE Webinar series on Jan 12! Join us! https://www.dataone.org/webinars/repo-discovery/**

Participate in this project with us by suggesting black cards and white cards. Add a card by creating a new issue.

Visit the individual issues to upvote (or thumbs up) the ones you really like to make sure they get added to the final collection.

# How to Play Cards Against Humanity 

To start the game, each player draws seven White Cards.

One randomly chosen player begins as the Card Czar and plays a Black Card. The Card Czar reads the question or fill-in-the-blank phrase on the Black Card out loud.

Everyone else answers the question or fills in the blank by passing one White Card, face down, to the Card Czar.

The Card Czar shuffles all of the answers and shares each card combination with the group. For full effect, the Card Czar should usually re-read the Black Card before presenting each answer.

The Card Czar then picks a favorite, and whoever played that answer keeps the Black Card as one Awesome Point.

After the round, a new player becomes the Card Czar and everyone draws back up to seven White Cards.

# Notes

Please make sure to keep this more or less family friendly - no profanity or vulgar cards will make it to the final deck. Be silly, be funny, but don't be gross. Also, please don't make cards that attack any particular group based on gender, religion, political preference, or discipline. (Likely goes without saying but just in case.)

Email Erin at mclean@nceas.ucsb.edu if there is a card that makes you uncomfortable, and I will take it down with no questions asked.
